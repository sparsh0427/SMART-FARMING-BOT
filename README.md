# SMART-FARMING-BOT

## PURPOSE

Agribusiness is considered as the pioneer of life for the human
beings as it is the central origin of food grains and other raw
materials. Of the many points of interest, IoT conveys to the
table, its capacity to advance the trends of current cultivating
procedures in agriculture is completely notable. IoT sensors fit
for furnishing agriculturists with data about harvest yields,
precipitation, pest invasion and soil sustenance which are
important to revenue generation and offer exact information
which can be utilized to enhance cultivating procedures over
time .

Traditional strategies rely upon human power for lifting,
dragging, weed control, harvesting. People are inclined to work
in unsafe condition while splashing chemicals and pesticides.
The tractors that minimal the farming actions are bigger in
weight and can't move in territory conditions.

We therefore, have come up with the idea of crop monitoring
and smart faming using IoT and APP development.

## PURPOSE

Our application will provide the farmer a guidance
about the crop requirements such as water, air
quality, temperature, humidity etc. Also, we are
planning to implement machine learning and make
our product more efficient in the future.
Thus, it is an automation system which will
increase the productivity and decrease the manual
and hard work of farmers. Major Functions of our
System: 

●Generate the crop requirements such as mposyure
levels.
●Detection of insects on crops
● Eco-friendly
●Less Human Effort
●Automation in Farming
●Digitalization in Agriculture sector
●To overcome the demands and increase
productivity.

## Operating Environment:

Hardware components environment of our
application include Arduino and sensors for
calculating temperature soil moisture levels, smoke
sensors etc. Software components of our system
include Android Studio to build an application,
Arduino IDE for sensor purpose.

## Software Interfaces:
### i. Languages-

##### • Java:
android studio uses android Java as a base
programming language. Java is robust,
secure, and reliable, inter operable language,
which make your system more and more
reliable, reusable, available and easily
understandable. Java is used to program the
events, processes.

##### • C/C++:
Arduino language is merely a set of C/C++
functions that can be called from your code.
Your sketch undergoes minor changes (e.g.
automatic generation of function prototypes)
and then is passed directly to a C/C++
compiler (avr-g++).

### ii. Mobile/desktop application-

##### • Android Studio:
Windows support android studio, the current
version we are using is 2.2 with lollipop and
marshmallow operating system. Currently
the craze of android language makes us a
decision to choose this language.

## Communication Interfaces:

### Bluetooth:
HC-05 module is an easy to use Bluetooth SPP
(Serial Port Protocol) module, designed for
transparent wireless serial connection setup.

## Functional Requirements:
The user must possess a smartphone that should have
Bluetooth functionality. Also, currently the given
project is operable using an android phone only. Also,
the user must download an app named ARDUTOOTH
beforehand to use our application.
